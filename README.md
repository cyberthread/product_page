# Product Page
A common design pattern on e-commerce websites is a [product page](http://ui-patterns.com/patterns/ProductPage). This is the page you would go to after browsing multiple product options where you can get more product details and add the product to the cart.

For this exercise, imagine you are designing your own e-commerce website (and not using an existing template) to sell physical objects you have designed and/or made (posters, stickers, apparel, handmade objects, etc.). Create a product page for one product (keeping in mind that this will act as a template for future products). 

## Requirements
### Content
- [ ] Product name, photo, price, "Add to cart" or equivalent button
- [ ] At least two other items noted in [UI Design Pattern: product page](http://ui-patterns.com/patterns/ProductPage. Please note that reviews are a separate pattern that may be embedded on a page but is an entirely separate design pattern and out of scope for this assignment. 

### Technical
- [ ] HTML is valid
- [ ] CSS is Valid
- [ ] Passes Accessibility Audit (submit report; note you will get an email with a summary of your responses, you'll want to use the link at the top that says "Link to view results" to get the full report -- I recommend having someone else do the audit for you and you returning the favor for someone else)
- [ ] Optimize for mobile and use [@media](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media) to add enhancements for larger screen sizes.
- [ ] Use [@supports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports) to enhance the experience for newer browsers.
- [ ] Site is live
- [ ] Code is well organized and commented

### Process
- [ ] Document process in Miro Whiteboard
- [ ] Collect at least 10 examples of product pages from different websites for reference (be sure to look at multiple screen sizes)
- [ ] Sketch *multiple* design ideas out. Explore options at different screen sizes.
- [ ] Ask for and record (take notes on) feedback from at least two peers
- [ ] Ask one peer to do an accessibility audit for you
- [ ] Code was written in chunks and committed to GitHub when individual components were complete.
- [ ] Images and content are properly documented in a copyright documentation spreadsheet
- [ ] Asked for feedback (and take notes on) from Rebecca and/or Andjela during class time

### Design
- [ ] Content is chunked well and easy to read and skim
- [ ] Different types of content are styled differently
- [ ] Design works well on small screens (easy to read/browse and navigate)
- [ ] Design works well on a range of medium-sized screens (easy to read/browse and navigate)
- [ ] Design works well on large screens (think 24" wide with over 5000px). The design should take advantage of the physical space available.
- [ ] Composition is interesting and unique (it doesn't replicate everything we've seen before). Risks have clearly been taken.
- [ ] Design uses imagery in a powerful and interesting way (and doesn't replicate everything we've seen before) that complements the types of products you'd be selling

## Evaluation
The requirements above will be equally weighted and evaluated as "meets", "approaches" or "does not meet." 

## Submission
Submit this exercise on blackboard. Include the following:
- [ ] URL to live site
- [ ] URL to Miro board
- [ ] URL to Accessibility Audit
- [ ] Screenshot of HTML Validation
- [ ] Screenshot of CSS Validation
- [ ] Copyright documentation
